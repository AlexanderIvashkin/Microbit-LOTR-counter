# Microbit-LOTR-counter
A generic round counter for tabletop games (built with LOTR: The LCG in mind) created to run on the BBC Microbit.

## Installation
Install the .hex file onto your BBC Microbit.

## Usage
Press the "A" button to increase the number of rounds. The Microbit will count them with dots (top-down and left-to-right).
When the dot is blinking it means that the round is in progress. Press the "A" again to finish the round (useful for tracking end-of-round events).

Press the "B" button to show the number of elapsed rounds with digits.

Touch the 0 and 1 pins to change the brightness in a cycle.

Touch and hold the 0 and 2 pins to see a light show :)
